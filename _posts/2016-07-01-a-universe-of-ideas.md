# A Universe of Ideas

### "If you perceive the universe as being a universe of abundance, then it will be. If you think of the universe as one of scarcity, then it will be. ... I always thought there was enough of everything to go around ---that there are enough ideas in the universe and enough nourishment."  
--- Milton Glaser
